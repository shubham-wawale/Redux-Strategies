# Redux Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of text files documenting my journey through mastering Redux and its integration with React. Each file covers different aspects of Redux, allowing me to apply these skills to real-world projects.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **AsyncThunk**
   - Handling asynchronous logic in Redux using `createAsyncThunk`, covering best practices for async actions, loading states, and errors.

### 2. **ConnectAPI**
   - Connecting Redux with external APIs, managing request states, and normalizing response data for performance.

### 3. **CreateSelector**
   - Using `reselect` to optimize state selection, reducing re-renders, and improving app performance.

### 4. **Redux Toolkit**
   - Simplifying Redux development with Redux Toolkit, focusing on easier store setup, less boilerplate code, and improved developer experience.

### 5. **ReduxAPI**
   - Core Redux API concepts like actions, reducers, and middleware, and how they work together in a Redux application.

## Why This Makes Me a Better React Developer

Mastering Redux enhances my ability to manage complex state in React applications, handle asynchronous operations efficiently, optimize performance with `reselect`, and reduce boilerplate code with Redux Toolkit. These skills make my applications more scalable, maintainable, and performant.
